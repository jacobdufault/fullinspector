For v2.6.4

New:
- Added AOT FullSerializer serialization pipeline which can greatly reduce FI performance instantation impact. See "Window/Full Inspector/Aot Serialization Manager" to get started.
- Added context state to property editors, which allows a property editor to fetch the parent object. This allows attribute editors to make behavior changes based on the instance that hosts the variable they are editing. See [InspectorDisabledIf] for an example implementation.
- Added [InspectorDisabledIf], similar to [InspectorShowIf] and [InspectorHideIf].
- [InspectorShowIf] and [InspectorHideIf] now support multiple fields/properties.
- Decreased initialization time with some reflection optimizations.
- Added Lines helper to [InspectorTextArea].
- Experimental multi-object editing. There are major known issues.
- Added fiSettings.EnableGlobalOrdering to make [InspectorOrder] global.
- [InspectorTooltip] can now be added to a class. The tooltip will be shown on the "Name" property that every inspector starts with.
- Added BaseBehavior.SharedStatePrefabInstantiation, which allows a behavior to skip serialization cloning when being cloned as part of an UnityObject.Instantiate call. This can significantly speedup object duplication, but state is now shared between the instances.

Changes:
- Don't auto-serialize prefabs while playing.
- Better logic to destroy old fiBackupSceneStorage instances that have been corrupted.
- The serializer manager will no longer automatically show itself.
- fiInspectorOnly for ScriptableObjects is now a fallback editor.

- Fixed Full Serializer exception being thrown for Window Store non-il2cpp builds.
- Fixed existing prefab instance members being overriden when changing a MonoBehaviour type to a BaseBehavior type.
- Fixed occasional null deref from OnSceneGUI.


For v2.6.3

New:
- InspectorCategory now works at a class level. You can use this behavior to set the default category for items without an [InspectorCategory] annotation.
- Added new option, fiSettings.DisplaySingleCategory, which hides the category UI if there is only one category (off by default).
- Added new option to disable internal logging.
- [internal]: Reworked serialization to support new Unity 5.4 restrictions. Everything should continue to "just work".
- Object reference fields now display the type of component they are referencing.

Changes:
- The char editor now mirrors Unity's default behavior.
- Adding a derived-type which extends Component no longer implicity adds an instance of that Component to the GameObject.
- [InspectorSkipInheritance] will now also skip inheritance for null objects.
- Added support for Stack<T>.
- Fix compilation warnings introduced in new versions of Unity.
- Fixed issue where ISerializationCallbacks.OnAfterDeserialized would not always be called.

- The script reference is now disabled, mirroring a Unity inspector change.

Fixes:
- Fixed regression where [InspectorDropnameName] stopped working.
- Fixed bad warning message when editing Gradient types.
- Fixed issue where the first edit to a BaseBehavior would not be saved.
- Fixed issue where metadata would not be properly migrated (in say, a dictionary).
- You can no longer drag scene references to persistent (prefab, etc) assets.
- Reverted undo optimization that would sometimes break undo.
- Various SharedInstance fixes.
- Added a check that ensures that destroyed objects will not be serialized.

- Fixed rare issue when reordering items in a list where the structural metadata would not get properly reassociated.
- UnityObject picker now always allows scene objects.
- Fixed Unity 5.3 compilation error for BaseNetworkBehavior. BaseNetworkBehavior now only supports FullSerializer.
- Fixed EditorSceneManager API call.
- Better error message when adding null key to dictionary.
- Entirely rewrote LayerMask property editor; this fixes code modifications to LayerMask fields not being applied.
- Fix warning message about a missing reference (introduced by a Unity regression).


For v2.6.2

New:
- Added IsCollapsedByDefault to InspectorCollectionShowItemDropdownAttribute.
- Added InspectorKeyWidthAttribute, which (for example), allows you to modify the width of the keys inside of a dictionary.

For v2.6.1 (4/13/2015)

New:
- Added [InspectorCollapsedFoldout] to collapse a field or property by default in the inspector.
- Added [InspectorCollectionItemAttributes] and [InspectorCollectionAddItemAttributes] which allow you to specify which attributes to use when rendering collection items.
- Added fiSettings.PrettyPrintSerializedJson to serialize pretty JSON, which may assist teams when merging assets that contain FI serialized data.
- You can now change the default comment type for [InspectorComment] via fiSettings.DefaultCommentType.
- Added fiSettings.ForceDisplayInlineObjectEditor which will force the inline object editor to always appear.
- Editor serialization logic has been completely rewritten. It should now just work in every scenario.

Changes:
- Full Inspector windows will now be centered on the screen.
- The JSON editor is now disabled by default (as it makes the default TextAsset editor unusable).

- Added `[fiInspectorOnly]` which will activate Full Inspector for any class/struct (without serialization support).
- Dropdowns are now persistent!
- [InspectorTooltip] can now be used with methods annotated with [InspectorButton]
- Added DefaultBehaviorEditor{TBehavior}, which easily allows you to create custom behavior editors with a custom editor below/above the default editor.

- You can now fetch the protobuf-net schema used for serialization with `ProtoBufNetSerializer.GetSchema` [from Jacob Liechty].
- Added `fiSettings.SerializeAutoProperties` which will disable serializing and inspecting auto-properties by default [from Jacob Liechty].
- Added a `WeakReference` property editor (and serialization with Full Serializer)
- [NotSerialize], [fsIgnore], etc now will cause members to be hidden in the inspector on non-UnityEngine.Object types
- Added a viewer for JSON files - simply click a json file in your assets directory and the inspector will display a nice UI for it (read-only).
- Static fields/properties can now be displayed in the inspector with [ShowInInspector]. Note: static fields will not be serialized - as a result, [SerializeField], [fsProperty], etc are prevented from acting like [ShowInInspector] when the member is static.
- Full Serializer now supports partial deserialization
- Various performance improvements for Full Serializer
- Readded Unity 4.3 support so that console exports (ie, PS4) work

- Fixed rect property editor w/o label

Fixes:

- Reworked CSharpName logic to better handle nested types.
- Various internal changes to support third-party extensions

For v2.5 (1/6/2015, commit hash 933817e02bebe11ed023f5988a1cbcb6c91ae70d)

** Important **
- Only auto-properties are displayed and serialized by default now

New:
- Added fiValue{T}, which allows perfect Full Inspector integration into any project *without* deriving from BaseBehavior.
- Added serializer migration utility which assists with changing serialization data between serializers.
- Animation support can now be toggled in fiSettings (with EnableAnimation).
- Full Inspector now tracks versions and will prompt you to do a clean import from 2.4.
- Added an "About Window" with quick links to some common Full Inspector utilities.
- Added [InspectorShowIf], which allows for conditional field/property/button display in the inspector.
- Added [InspectorDropdownName], which allows you to customize the name a type appears as in the abstract type dropdown selector.
- Added [InspectorCollectionRotorzFlags], which allows complete customization of the flags that are sent to Rotorz for list editing.
- Added [InspectorNotDefaultConstructed], which prevents default construction of the given field/property.
- Support treating methods with all default parameters as no parameter methods.
- Collections are now paged when they have more than a certain number of elements. This can be customized with the [InspectorCollectionPager] attribute.
- You can now easily customize settings by writing a class that extends from `fiSettingsProcessor`.

Changes:
- Default label width now matches Unity.
- Edit/GetHeight are now statically exposed on DefaultBehaviorEditor.
- Reset is no longer automatically invoked when adding a behavior to an object.
- Add support for runtime types in SerializationHelpers.
- Full Inspector generated code will now be placed in a directory named `fiSettings.RootDirectory + "_Generated"`.
- [Limits] has been promoted to the core namespace as [InspectorRange]
- SharedInstance can now take an extra generic argument for the serializer to use.
- [InspectorDatabaseEditor] now works with arrays.
- Exceptions are now logged using Debug.LogException, which makes it much easier to navigate to the exception source.
- Added exception logging for BehaviorEditor and PropertyEditor constructors.
- Removed all default parameters so that MonoDevelop correctly builds Full Inspector
- Made serializer detection significantly more robust
- You no longer need to mark modified objects with SetDirty; they will be automatically serialized (assuming they were initially serialized).
- The static inspector can now be opened with `Alt-I`.

Fixes:
- Fixed internal exception when a property accessor with a struct return type threw an exception.
- Correctly set GUI.changed when creating new object instances.
- Fixed return type for OnWillDeleteAsset callback.
- Fixed a Unity deserialization race when entering play mode in the editor.
- Fixed Rotorz rendering when Unity is in a Linear colorspace
- Fixed serialization on BaseBehavior for unsigned types and signed shorts.

- Fixed metadata leak causing an excessive number of metadata objects to exist in a long-running scene (though they are cleaned up after entering/exiting Unity)
- Fixed fiRuntimeReflectionUtility.GetRuntimeAssemblies() in WebPlayer


For v2.4

New:
- Full Inspector now includes an object backup system for the Unity Editor. Just right-click a behavior and click "Backup". It even works across play mode! Each scene has it's own set of backup data.
- The ObjectPropertyEditor now has a toggle that allows for an inline view of the selected object.
- Introduce "BehaviorEditor" as a mirror to PropertyEditor system. BehaviorEditors are used for creating editors for types which derive from BaseBehavior or from BaseScriptableObject. This fixes a critical bug where object references were not displayed properly when BaseBehavior/BaseScriptableObject types had a custom property editor.
- Introduce LayoutToolkit, which makes it easy to create declarative UI's using Unity's immediate mode GUI. It's an allocation free alternative to GUILayout that also works in GUILayout restricted areas.
- Introduce serialize selector, which makes it easy to select which serializer you want to use as the default.
- Add support for Full Serializer, an automated serializer that just works with the same serialization interface that Unity uses -- this is a free serializer that works on all of the Unity export platforms.
- You can now use [JsonProperty], [JsonIgnore], [ProtoMember], etc, on BaseBehavior/ScriptableObject members!
- Foldouts are now animated
- Introdue the Facade{T}, which allows for editing, say, a BaseBehavior type in the inspector *without* creating an instance of it.
- A new metadata engine (fiGraphMetadata) has been introduced. It stores metadata based on the structure of the object/property editor graph. The IPropertyEditor API has changed slightly to accommodate it. Additionally, ObjectMetadata has been renamed to fiGlobalMetadata.
- Added serialization callbacks on BaseBehavior/BaseScriptableObject types with the ISerializationCallbacks interface.
- protobuf-net serializer can now ignore selected assemblies. See TypeModelCreator.AssemblyIgnoreList.
- Gradients are now fully supported.
- Added a NullSerializer that bypasses all serialization. This is useful if you wish to just use Unity serialization but want to utilize the Full Inspector inspector interface.
- Added [InspectorHeader], an analog to Unity's new [Header] attribute
- Added [InspectorCollectionShowItemDropdown] to show dropdown arrows on collection items.
- Added [InspectorTextArea], to show a text-area instead of a text-field for string types.
- Added [InspectorName] to set the name to use for a field, property, or method in the inspector.
- Read-only properties will now be displayed by default.
- Serialized fields are now displayed by default. This means that for private fields, adding [SerializeField] is enough -- no need to also add [ShowInInspector].
- Introduce SharedInstance<T>, which makes it easy to share object instances across serialization contexts.
- Introduce TypeSpecifier<TBaseType>, which makes using Types in the Inspector even easier! Only types that are assignable to TBaseType will be pickable in the inspector.

Fixes:
- Fixed inspector rendering issues for object graphs with cycles.
- Fixed inspector rendering issues for recursive type definitions.
- Fix LayerMask editor when the layer is set to a negative value.
- Read-only properties will now be displayed with a disabled GUI.
- Fixed issue where DateTime editor would change the value in the DateTime.
- Fix private fields on a BaseBehavior/BaseScriptableObject with a [SerializedField] annotation not being serialized.
- Foldouts are now displayed whenever a sub-item is above a certain height, regardless of the type being edited.
- If a foldout was displayed for an item before and the item shrinks in height, the foldout will now continue to be displayed.
- Selected a type that derives from BaseBehavior in the abstract type drop-down will no longer emit a warning about component construction.
- OnValidate will now be called whenever the inspector has changed.
- Dropdown states and the like will now be saved across play-mode.
- Fix protobuf-net serialization issue where only the first UnityObject reference was restored.
- The Rect property editor will now display less information.
- Fix issue where overriding a property would display it in the inspector twice.
- Fix deserialization issue with nullable Vector types in Json.NET
- Moving the base FI2 directory around is now fully supported.

Misc:
- Optimization pass over the memory allocation profile for Full Inspector (approx 5x reduction, so 100kb -> 20kb).
- Optimization pass over startup time - first inspector views should now be nearly instant.
- Removed warnings from the static inspector.
- Assembly filtering has been improved, hopefully leading to faster reload times.
- Full Inspector will now only scan editor assemblies for custom property editors.
- Abstract type selection dropdown is now sorted by name.
- Parent members will now be displayed before derived members in the inspector.
- Added missing DateTimeOffset editor.
- Minor polish: variable names like "ID" will now be displayed as "ID" instead of "I D"
- Renamed MarginAttribute to InspectorMarginAttribute
- Renamed TooltipAttribute to InspectorTooltipAttribute
- Renamed SingleItemListEditorAttribute to InspectorDatabaseEditorAttribute
- FullInspectorSettings has been renamed to fiSettings and has been moved out of Core/ into the top-level Full Inspector directory.
- Fields/properties are now lazily written. This means that property set methods will be invoked only when the value has actually changed in the case of value-types.
- API NOTICE: GetElementHeight is now automatically cached. Calling it from an Edit function will return a cached value instead of recomputing it.


For v2.3 (5/14/2014, commit hash 006b660f0539f495995c9c66bb6cb9d019f83eab)

New:
- Added the static inspector, which allows easy inspecting of static/global variables directly from within Unity

- Methods can now be easily displayed in the inspector using the [InspectorButton] attribute
- Inspector attribute property editors can now explicitly state what order they should appear in via extending IInspectorAttributeOrder
- Added [InspectorHidePrimary] property attribute that hides the primary inspector. This is extremely useful for displaying a comment inside of an inspector that is not associated with any editor.
- Added new [InspectorDivider] attribute that draws a divider in the inspector
- Introduced PropertyEditorChain abstraction for those writing custom property editors; see docs.
- Add EditWithGUILayout extension method to IPropertyEditor that makes a property editor easily usable within a GUILayout section (note: this is *not* GUILayout support within property editors -- sorry!)
- Added a property editor for System.Type
- Added a very basic property editor for System.ICustomAttributeProvider
- Added property editors for System.DateTime and System.TimeSpan
- Added a new CommentType enum to the CommentAttribute, allowing an info, warning, or error image to be displayed with the comment
- Added a custom property editor for nullable types

Fixes:

- A collapsed array/list/dictionary will now show the number of elements in the collapsed container

Samples:
- Added two simple sample games (platformer and arena)

API:
- Default implementations are now provided for all (Attribute)PropertyEditor<TElement> methods, which simplifies implementing, for example, just an OnSceneGUI method.

Fixes:

- Replaced SurrogateSelector with custom implementation; SurrogateSelector could not disambiguate between two types with the same name but in different assemblies.
- BinaryFormatter is now using a custom SerializationBinder that is more robust to type changes


For v2.0 (3/13/2014)

- Ref has been removed!
- You no longer have to annotate your BaseBehavior derived type. In BaseBehaviors, public fields / properties are serialized by default.
